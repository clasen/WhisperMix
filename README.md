# üéôÔ∏è WhisperMix

WhisperMix is a flexible module that provides an interface for transcribing audio using OpenAI's Whisper model, Groq's Whisper Large v3 model, or local Whisper models.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install whispermix
```

For local Whisper support, also install the optional dependencies:

```bash
npm install @xenova/transformers audio-decode
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before using WhisperMix with API-based models, you need to set up your environment variables:

- For OpenAI's Whisper: Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment or `.env` file.
- For Groq's Whisper Large v3: Set `GROQ_API_KEY` in your environment or `.env` file.
- For local Whisper: No API key required.

## üöÄ Usage

First, import the WhisperMix class:

```javascript
import WhisperMix from 'whispermix';
```

### üîß Initializing WhisperMix

You can initialize WhisperMix with a specific model:

```javascript
const whisper = new WhisperMix({ model: 'openai' }); // For OpenAI's Whisper
// or
const whisperGroq = new WhisperMix({ model: 'groq/large-v3' }); // For Groq's Whisper Large v3
// or
const whisperLocal = new WhisperMix({ model: 'xenova/large-v3' }); // For local Whisper
```

### üìÑ Transcribing from a File

```javascript
const filePath = 'path/to/your/audio/file.mp3';
whisperGroq.fromFile(filePath)
  .then(transcription => console.log(transcription))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));

// For local Whisper with language specification
const whisperLocal = new WhisperMix({ 
  model: 'xenova/large-v3',
  language: 'spanish' // Optional
});
whisperLocal.fromFile(filePath)
  .then(transcription => console.log(transcription))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

### üåä Transcribing from a Stream

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
const audioStream = fs.createReadStream('path/to/your/audio/file.mp3');

whisperGroq.fromStream(audioStream)
  .then(transcription => console.log(transcription))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

**Note:** Stream transcription is only available for API-based models (OpenAI and Groq). Local Whisper models require file input.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Long Audio Processing

WhisperMix automatically handles long audio files by splitting them into smaller segments if they exceed 15 minutes in duration. This process is transparent to the user and works with both API-based and local models:

The segmented transcriptions are automatically merged into a single result, ensuring a smooth experience when working with content of any length.

### üö¶ Rate Limiting Configuration

WhisperMix uses Bottleneck for rate limiting API-based models. You can configure the Bottleneck settings when initializing WhisperMix:

```javascript
const whisper = new WhisperMix({
  model: 'whisper-1',
  bottleneck: {
    minTime: 3000,
    maxConcurrent: 1,
    reservoir: 18,
    reservoirRefreshAmount: 18,
    reservoirRefreshInterval: 60000
  }
});
```

The default Bottleneck configuration is:

- `minTime`: 3000 ms (minimum time between requests)
- `maxConcurrent`: 1 (maximum number of concurrent requests)
- `reservoir`: 18 (number of requests that can be made before throttling)
- `reservoirRefreshAmount`: 18 (number of requests added back to the reservoir)
- `reservoirRefreshInterval`: 60000 ms (time interval for refreshing the reservoir)

You can adjust these settings based on your specific rate limiting needs. Note that rate limiting is not applied to local Whisper models.

## üìö API

### `new WhisperMix(options)`

Creates a new WhisperMix instance.

- `options.model`: The model to use for transcription. Can be 'whisper-1' (OpenAI), 'whisper-large-v3' (Groq), or 'whisper-local' (local).
- `options.bottleneck`: (Optional) Configuration for Bottleneck rate limiting (API models only).
- `options.chunkSize`: (Optional) The size in seconds of the chunks to split the audio into. Default is 890 seconds.
- `options.language`: (Optional) Language for local Whisper model. Defaults to 'auto' for automatic detection.
### `whisper.fromFile(filePath)`

Transcribes audio from a file.

- `filePath`: Path to the audio file.

Returns a Promise that resolves with the transcription text.

### `whisper.fromStream(audioStream)`

Transcribes audio from a stream.

- `audioStream`: A readable stream of the audio data.

Returns a Promise that resolves with the transcription text.

**Note:** Only available for API-based models (OpenAI and Groq). Local Whisper models will throw an error.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

WhisperMix throws errors for API request failures and local processing issues. Always wrap your calls in try-catch blocks or use `.catch()` with promises to handle potential errors.

For local Whisper models, ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
```bash
npm install @xenova/transformers audio-decode
```
