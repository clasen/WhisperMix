# üéôÔ∏è WhisperMix

WhisperMix is a flexible module that provides an interface for transcribing audio using OpenAI's Whisper model or Groq's Whisper Large v3 model.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install whispermix
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before using WhisperMix, you need to set up your environment variables:

- For OpenAI's Whisper: Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment or `.env` file.
- For Groq's Whisper Large v3: Set `GROQ_API_KEY` in your environment or `.env` file.

## üöÄ Usage

First, import the WhisperMix class:

```javascript
const WhisperMix = require('whispermix');
```

### üîß Initializing WhisperMix

You can initialize WhisperMix with a specific model:

```javascript
const whisper = new WhisperMix({ model: 'whisper-1' }); // For OpenAI's Whisper
// or
const whisper = new WhisperMix({ model: 'whisper-large-v3' }); // For Groq's Whisper Large v3
```

### üìÑ Transcribing from a File

```javascript
const filePath = 'path/to/your/audio/file.mp3';
whisper.fromVoiceFile(filePath)
  .then(transcription => console.log(transcription))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

### üåä Transcribing from a Stream

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const audioStream = fs.createReadStream('path/to/your/audio/file.mp3');

whisper.fromVoiceStream(audioStream)
  .then(transcription => console.log(transcription))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

## üìö API
