# üéôÔ∏è WhisperMix

WhisperMix is a flexible module that provides an interface for transcribing audio using OpenAI's Whisper model or Groq's Whisper Large v3 model.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install whispermix
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before using WhisperMix, you need to set up your environment variables:

- For OpenAI's Whisper: Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment or `.env` file.
- For Groq's Whisper Large v3: Set `GROQ_API_KEY` in your environment or `.env` file.

## üöÄ Usage

First, import the WhisperMix class:

```javascript
const WhisperMix = require('whispermix');
```

### üîß Initializing WhisperMix

You can initialize WhisperMix with a specific model:

```javascript
const whisper = new WhisperMix({ model: 'whisper-1' }); // For OpenAI's Whisper
// or
const whisperGroq = new WhisperMix({ model: 'whisper-large-v3' }); // For Groq's Whisper Large v3
```

### üìÑ Transcribing from a File

```javascript
const filePath = 'path/to/your/audio/file.mp3';
whisperGroq.fromFile(filePath)
  .then(transcription => console.log(transcription))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

### üåä Transcribing from a Stream

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const audioStream = fs.createReadStream('path/to/your/audio/file.mp3');

whisperGroq.fromStream(audioStream)
  .then(transcription => console.log(transcription))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è Long Audio Processing

WhisperMix automatically handles long audio files by splitting them into smaller segments if they exceed 15 minutes in duration. This process is transparent to the user:

The segmented transcriptions are automatically merged into a single result, ensuring a smooth experience when working with content of any length.

### üö¶ Bottleneck Configuration

WhisperMix uses Bottleneck for rate limiting. You can configure the Bottleneck settings when initializing WhisperMix:

```javascript
const whisper = new WhisperMix({
  model: 'whisper-1',
  bottleneck: {
    minTime: 3000,
    maxConcurrent: 1,
    reservoir: 18,
    reservoirRefreshAmount: 18,
    reservoirRefreshInterval: 60000
  }
});
```

The default Bottleneck configuration is:

- `minTime`: 3000 ms (minimum time between requests)
- `maxConcurrent`: 1 (maximum number of concurrent requests)
- `reservoir`: 18 (number of requests that can be made before throttling)
- `reservoirRefreshAmount`: 18 (number of requests added back to the reservoir)
- `reservoirRefreshInterval`: 60000 ms (time interval for refreshing the reservoir)

You can adjust these settings based on your specific rate limiting needs.

## üìö API

### `new WhisperMix(options)`

Creates a new WhisperMix instance.

- `options.model`: The model to use for transcription. Can be 'whisper-1' (OpenAI) or 'whisper-large-v3' (Groq).
- `options.bottleneck`: (Optional) Configuration for Bottleneck rate limiting.
- `options.chunkSize`: (Optional) The size in seconds of the chunks to split the audio into. Default is 890 seconds.
### `whisper.fromFile(filePath)`

Transcribes audio from a file.

- `filePath`: Path to the audio file.

Returns a Promise that resolves with the transcription text.

### `whisper.fromStream(audioStream)`

Transcribes audio from a stream.

- `audioStream`: A readable stream of the audio data.

Returns a Promise that resolves with the transcription text.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

WhisperMix throws errors for API request failures. Always wrap your calls in try-catch blocks or use `.catch()` with promises to handle potential errors.
